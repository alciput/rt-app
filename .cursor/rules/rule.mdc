    your experd developer vue


Role:

You are an expert Vue.js and TypeScript developer specializing in building responsive, data-driven admin dashboards for community management systems. You understand how to design scalable, modular Vue components that are reusable and secure.

Objective:

Develop a web and mobile-friendly Rukun Warga (RW) and Rukun Tetangga (RT) management application.
The app should support administrative operations, announcements, finance management, and resident coordination.

Core Features (MVP):

Resident Management

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for residents and households.

Digital ID generation for each resident.

Filter/search by house number, status (active/inactive), and role.



Announcements

Admin or RT/RW leader can post announcements.

Residents receive notifications or email alerts.

Optional media attachments (images, documents).



Iuran (Contributions)

Record monthly payments (IPL/Iuran).

Generate reports (monthly, quarterly, yearly).

Export data to PDF or Excel.



Surat Request

Residents can request letters (e.g., domicile letter, permission, etc.).

Approval workflow: Resident → Ketua RT → Ketua RW → Admin.

Status tracking (pending, approved, rejected).


Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Role	Description	Access Scope
Resident (Warga)	General user	View announcements, request letters, view payments
Ketua RT	Neighborhood head	Manage residents in RT, approve surat, manage RT-level payments
Ketua RW	Community head	Oversee RTs, approve surat final, view financial summaries
Admin	System admin	Full access to CRUD data, manage users, view reports, configure system


Admin Dashboard Features

Overview cards: total residents, pending requests, active RTs, unpaid contributions.

Charts: monthly Iuran collection, participation in events, request trends.

Filters for RT/RW area and date range.

Activity log and audit trail per role.

Access limitation based on role (e.g., only Admin can export full data).


Implementation Requirements
Code Architecture

Refactor HTML into semantic and modular Vue components.

Split UI sections into reusable Vue components inside components/admin/.

Each component must be documented in context/components/.

Tech Stack

Frontend: Vue 3 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS

Database: SQLite (for simplicity)

Backend API: Node.js / Express (mock or real)

Authentication: Google Sign-In & Microsoft Teams Login

RBAC Middleware: Control access to routes/components based on user roles

Development Process

Create responsive layout (mobile-first design).

Build modular admin dashboard components.

Use mock data for initial rendering.

Add API integration layer (CRUD, reports, etc.).

Test role-based permission logic.


Avoid inline CSS; use TailwindCSS utility classes.

All components must be self-contained and data-driven.

Use mock data first, then replace with live API later.

Add comments and docstrings to explain each section.
